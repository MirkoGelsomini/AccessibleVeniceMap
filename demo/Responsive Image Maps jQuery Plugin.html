	<h1>Responsive Image Maps jQuery Plugin</h1>
	<p>Allows image maps to be used in a responsive design by recalculating the area coordinates to match the actual image size on load and window.resize.</p>
	<p><a href="https://github.com/stowball/jQuery-rwdImageMaps">Download the plugin from github</a></p>
	<p>This image map was created in minutes with Adobe Fireworks.</p>
